- GitHub Copilot for inline completions while coding.
- Claude (VS Code) for alternative reasoning and second opinions in-editor.
- Gemini for cross-checking answers or alternative model perspectives.
- Wispr Flow for hands-free prompting and rapid ideation.
- Granola for meeting capture and post-meeting summaries that feed into artifacts.
- NotebookLM for quick synthesis of long docs and session notes.
- Use the repo tool references to align suggestions with existing practices.

## Tool Selection Cues
- Use ChatGPT Plus when you need broader ideation or narrative drafting.
- Use Cursor when changes need to stay consistent with repo structure and style.
- Use Copilot when you are writing code and want fast inline assistance.
- Use Claude when you want an alternative reasoning pass.
- Use Gemini when you are organizing calendar blocks or cross-checking answers.
- Use Wispr Flow when you are dictating notes or prompts hands-free.
- Use Granola when you are capturing meeting details for later synthesis.
- Use NotebookLM when you are scanning long docs for key points.

## Prompting and Safety Guidelines
- Ask for small, reviewable diffs.
- Prefer file-specific edits and scoped changes.
- Avoid secrets and credentials.
- Call out assumptions and unknowns.
- Request rollback plans for risky changes.
- Ask for source citations when adding new facts.
- Keep diffs consistent with existing style and structure.
- Prefer edits to existing files over new structure.

## Updating This Document
- Add new tools only when they are actually adopted.
- Include an approximate start date and reason for adoption.
- Note whether the tool is referenced in repo docs or workflow-only.
