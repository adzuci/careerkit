## Purpose
This repo is a career development toolkit for job search and interview support.
It captures repeatable workflows, templates, and study materials that are meant
to be forkable, extensible, and easy to maintain over time.

## Tone
- Intentional, signal-driven, and pragmatic
- Clear, concise, and friendly
- Focus on reusable patterns and actionable guidance
- Prefer evidence and examples over hype

## Organization
- Use `interview_prep/` for interview prep content and runnable examples.
- Use `interview_prep/ml/` for ML-specific prep materials.
- Use `tooling/` for automation notes, agent guidance, and dev helpers.
- Use root `README.md` for repo-wide navigation and high-level guidance.
- Prefer editing existing documents over introducing new directories.
- Keep additions small and reviewable; document assumptions when helpful.

## Editing Hygiene
- Avoid secrets or sensitive data; use redacted placeholders instead.
- Keep changes consistent with existing style and structure.
- If the correct location is unclear, pick the most likely spot and call it out.
