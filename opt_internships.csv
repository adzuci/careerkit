Application deadline: Applications will be accepted on an ongoing basis  

  

Job Summary:
  

  

At Amazon, we’re committed to promoting a safe working environment and being the most safety\-centric company for every team member. As an intern, you will have the opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of Amazon Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) practices. Your internship experience will involve a combination of safety\-related projects and WHS organizational learning initiatives.
  

  

Throughout the program, you will learn how to effectively implement safety improvements, identify compliance issues, and recognize opportunities for safety enhancements at your assigned site. Working alongside various safety leaders and stakeholders, you will contribute to creating and maintaining a safe workplace within our Network Distribution Centers. Upon completing your internship, you will be required to present a safety research paper and share the findings of your project with the leadership team. This will allow you to demonstrate your understanding of safety principles and showcase your valuable contributions to promoting a culture of safety within Amazon.  

  

This role will require 100% on\-site attendance located within one of our Network Distribution Centers, and will not be a virtual \- work from home position.
  

  

At Amazon, we thrive in a dynamic and rapidly evolving work environment, and our approach to safety is no exception. Just like the organization itself, our Safety department operates with agility and adaptability. As WHS Interns, you will have the invaluable opportunity to cultivate your own agility, learning to swiftly adjust strategies, plans, and solutions to keep pace with ever\-changing business demands. You will effortlessly learn how to collaborate and lead diverse functional teams and stakeholders across all levels of the organization. Our guiding principles include embracing open\-mindedness, prioritizing customer satisfaction, fostering innovation, promoting empowerment, leveraging advanced technologies, and fostering a strong sense of camaraderie within our team. These principles are what drive our WHS team to deliver cutting\-edge fulfillment solutions.
  

  

You may be wondering, what exactly is fulfillment? Fulfillment, in the context of Amazon, refers to the process of completing and delivering a customer's order from Amazon.com. It encompasses various stages such as picking, packing, shipping, and delivering the order, all with the aim of meeting or exceeding the customer's expectations.  

  

To better understand our operations, let's break down the workflow into three major lanes: first mile, middle mile, and last mile.  

  

* First mile: This is where the product is stored and made ready for picking when an order is placed. It's the starting point of the fulfillment process.
* Middle mile: In this stage, your order is sorted and prepared for distribution to your specific area. It involves efficient logistics and transportation to ensure your package reaches the next destination smoothly.
* Last mile: The last mile represents the final leg of the journey, where the product is delivered right to your doorstep. This step focuses on providing a seamless and convenient delivery experience for our customers.

  

It's important to note that while these lanes may have slight building variations depending on the specific fulfillment center, one constant remains: our unwavering vision and dedication to serving our customers. We strive to continuously improve and optimize our fulfillment processes to ensure customer satisfaction and exceed their expectations. Here are the types of facilities in each mile segment of fulfillment:  

  

* Fulfillment Centers (North America Customer Fulfillment \- NACF Network)o Large facilities with many associates, that house goods, both big and small (first\-mile). These are the types of building that typically come to mind when you hear fulfillment and may contain robotics technology or house the products available when you shop Amazon.com!
* Sort Centers (North America Sort Center \- NASC Network)


o Medium\-sized facilities, localized close to larger markets, where goods are sorted for delivery (middle\-mile). These buildings receive packaged orders and help the last\-mile network deliver products on\-time more efficiently. Orders are sorted by zip code, region, and size. These buildings operate most similarly to a regional post office or large third\-party logistics building.
  

o Air Sites (Amazon Air Network) Amazon’s dedicated Air network serving middle mile, located near or within major airport hubs. These locations require additional security clearances and background checks, managed by the local port authorities.
  

* Delivery Stations (Amazon Logistics \- AMZL Network)o Smaller facilities with fewer associates, localized close to larger markets, where goods are delivered directly to customers (last mile). This is the last stop in the life of an order, where it is packed onto a delivery truck before heading out to the customer’s address.

  

About the Program:
  

  

* The summer term is full\-time (40 hours a week) and lasts 10 weeks during the summer of 2026 (Colleges and Universities where 12 weeks are required for graduation will work directly with a recruiter if extended an offer). Start dates are offered in May and June.
* As a part of the Workplace Health and Safety Specialist (WHS) internship program, you will learn how to improve the safety and efficiency of our work style processes.
* Onboarding will include OSHA10, First Aid/CPR/AED certification, technical writing and intro to project management training.

  

PLEASE NOTE: For this role, it is essential to have the flexibility to relocate during the summer, as candidate placements will be prioritized based on business requirements. While we take into consideration the placement preferences of candidates, our recruiters will make their best efforts to accommodate location requests. For qualified candidates, we provide relocation and housing assistance to support the transition to the designated work location. Our aim is to ensure that candidates have the necessary support to successfully settle into their new work environment.  

  

Based on your performance during the internship, you will have the opportunity to receive an offer for full\-time employment upon graduation. The decision regarding full\-time employment will be communicated to all WHS interns within weeks after the conclusion of their internship. This ensures a timely and efficient process for determining your potential for continued employment with the company.  

  

Job Elements:  

  

Must be able to perform the following tasks, with or without reasonable accommodation:  

* Willing and able to work any shift that may include overnights and holidays. Note that there is a high chance that your shift may overlap into part of the weekend.

Key job responsibilities  

* Work with various Workplace Health and Safety Teams and other WHS interns on a safety related project.

Job Summary:
  

  

At Amazon, we’re committed to promoting a safe working environment and being the most safety\-centric company for every team member. As an intern, you will have the opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of Amazon Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) practices. Your internship experience will involve a combination of safety\-related projects and WHS organizational learning initiatives.
  

  

Throughout the program, you will learn how to effectively implement safety improvements, identify compliance issues, and recognize opportunities for safety enhancements at your assigned site. Working alongside various safety leaders and stakeholders, you will contribute to creating and maintaining a safe workplace within our Network Distribution Centers. Upon completing your internship, you will be required to present a safety research paper and share the findings of your project with the leadership team. This will allow you to demonstrate your understanding of safety principles and showcase your valuable contributions to promoting a culture of safety within Amazon.  

  

This role will require 100% on\-site attendance located within one of our Network Distribution Centers, and will not be a virtual \- work from home position.
  

  

At Amazon, we thrive in a dynamic and rapidly evolving work environment, and our approach to safety is no exception. Just like the organization itself, our Safety department operates with agility and adaptability. As WHS Interns, you will have the invaluable opportunity to cultivate your own agility, learning to swiftly adjust strategies, plans, and solutions to keep pace with ever\-changing business demands. You will effortlessly learn how to collaborate and lead diverse functional teams and stakeholders across all levels of the organization. Our guiding principles include embracing open\-mindedness, prioritizing customer satisfaction, fostering innovation, promoting empowerment, leveraging advanced technologies, and fostering a strong sense of camaraderie within our team. These principles are what drive our WHS team to deliver cutting\-edge fulfillment solutions.
  

  

You may be wondering, what exactly is fulfillment? Fulfillment, in the context of Amazon, refers to the process of completing and delivering a customer's order from Amazon.com. It encompasses various stages such as picking, packing, shipping, and delivering the order, all with the aim of meeting or exceeding the customer's expectations.  

  

To better understand our operations, let's break down the workflow into three major lanes: first mile, middle mile, and last mile.  

  

* First mile: This is where the product is stored and made ready for picking when an order is placed. It's the starting point of the fulfillment process.
* Middle mile: In this stage, your order is sorted and prepared for distribution to your specific area. It involves efficient logistics and transportation to ensure your package reaches the next destination smoothly.
* Last mile: The last mile represents the final leg of the journey, where the product is delivered right to your doorstep. This step focuses on providing a seamless and convenient delivery experience for our customers.

  

It's important to note that while these lanes may have slight building variations depending on the specific fulfillment center, one constant remains: our unwavering vision and dedication to serving our customers. We strive to continuously improve and optimize our fulfillment processes to ensure customer satisfaction and exceed their expectations. Here are the types of facilities in each mile segment of fulfillment:  

  

* Fulfillment Centers (North America Customer Fulfillment \- NACF Network)o Large facilities with many associates, that house goods, both big and small (first\-mile). These are the types of building that typically come to mind when you hear fulfillment and may contain robotics technology or house the products available when you shop Amazon.com!
* Sort Centers (North America Sort Center \- NASC Network)


o Medium\-sized facilities, localized close to larger markets, where goods are sorted for delivery (middle\-mile). These buildings receive packaged orders and help the last\-mile network deliver products on\-time more efficiently. Orders are sorted by zip code, region, and size. These buildings operate most similarly to a regional post office or large third\-party logistics building.
  

o Air Sites (Amazon Air Network) Amazon’s dedicated Air network serving middle mile, located near or within major airport hubs. These locations require additional security clearances and background checks, managed by the local port authorities.
  

* Delivery Stations (Amazon Logistics \- AMZL Network)o Smaller facilities with fewer associates, localized close to larger markets, where goods are delivered directly to customers (last mile). This is the last stop in the life of an order, where it is packed onto a delivery truck before heading out to the customer’s address.

  

About the Program:

* As a part of the Workplace Health and Safety Specialist (WHS) internship program, you will learn how to improve the safety and efficiency of our work style processes.
* Onboarding will include OSHA10, First Aid/CPR/AED certification, technical writing and intro to project management training.

For qualified candidates, we provide relocation and housing assistance to support the transition to the designated work location.

This ensures a timely and efficient process for determining your potential for continued employment with the company.

Job Summary:
  

  

At Amazon, we’re committed to promoting a safe working environment and being the most safety\-centric company for every team member. As an intern, you will have the opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of Amazon Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) practices. Your internship experience will involve a combination of safety\-related projects and WHS organizational learning initiatives.
  

  

Throughout the program, you will learn how to effectively implement safety improvements, identify compliance issues, and recognize opportunities for safety enhancements at your assigned site. Working alongside various safety leaders and stakeholders, you will contribute to creating and maintaining a safe workplace within our Network Distribution Centers. Upon completing your internship, you will be required to present a safety research paper and share the findings of your project with the leadership team. This will allow you to demonstrate your understanding of safety principles and showcase your valuable contributions to promoting a culture of safety within Amazon.  

  

This role will require 100% on\-site attendance located within one of our Network Distribution Centers, and will not be a virtual \- work from home position.
  

  

At Amazon, we thrive in a dynamic and rapidly evolving work environment, and our approach to safety is no exception. Just like the organization itself, our Safety department operates with agility and adaptability. As WHS Interns, you will have the invaluable opportunity to cultivate your own agility, learning to swiftly adjust strategies, plans, and solutions to keep pace with ever\-changing business demands. You will effortlessly learn how to collaborate and lead diverse functional teams and stakeholders across all levels of the organization. Our guiding principles include embracing open\-mindedness, prioritizing customer satisfaction, fostering innovation, promoting empowerment, leveraging advanced technologies, and fostering a strong sense of camaraderie within our team. These principles are what drive our WHS team to deliver cutting\-edge fulfillment solutions.
  

  

You may be wondering, what exactly is fulfillment? Fulfillment, in the context of Amazon, refers to the process of completing and delivering a customer's order from Amazon.com. It encompasses various stages such as picking, packing, shipping, and delivering the order, all with the aim of meeting or exceeding the customer's expectations.  

  

To better understand our operations, let's break down the workflow into three major lanes: first mile, middle mile, and last mile.  

  

* First mile: This is where the product is stored and made ready for picking when an order is placed. It's the starting point of the fulfillment process.
* Middle mile: In this stage, your order is sorted and prepared for distribution to your specific area. It involves efficient logistics and transportation to ensure your package reaches the next destination smoothly.
* Last mile: The last mile represents the final leg of the journey, where the product is delivered right to your doorstep. This step focuses on providing a seamless and convenient delivery experience for our customers.

  

It's important to note that while these lanes may have slight building variations depending on the specific fulfillment center, one constant remains: our unwavering vision and dedication to serving our customers. We strive to continuously improve and optimize our fulfillment processes to ensure customer satisfaction and exceed their expectations. Here are the types of facilities in each mile segment of fulfillment:  

  

* Fulfillment Centers (North America Customer Fulfillment \- NACF Network)o Large facilities with many associates, that house goods, both big and small (first\-mile). These are the types of building that typically come to mind when you hear fulfillment and may contain robotics technology or house the products available when you shop Amazon.com!
* Sort Centers (North America Sort Center \- NASC Network)


o Medium\-sized facilities, localized close to larger markets, where goods are sorted for delivery (middle\-mile). These buildings receive packaged orders and help the last\-mile network deliver products on\-time more efficiently. Orders are sorted by zip code, region, and size. These buildings operate most similarly to a regional post office or large third\-party logistics building.
  

o Air Sites (Amazon Air Network) Amazon’s dedicated Air network serving middle mile, located near or within major airport hubs. These locations require additional security clearances and background checks, managed by the local port authorities.
  

* Delivery Stations (Amazon Logistics \- AMZL Network)o Smaller facilities with fewer associates, localized close to larger markets, where goods are delivered directly to customers (last mile). This is the last stop in the life of an order, where it is packed onto a delivery truck before heading out to the customer’s address.

  

About the Program:
  

  

* The summer term is full\-time (40 hours a week) and lasts 10 weeks during the summer of 2026 (Colleges and Universities where 12 weeks are required for graduation will work directly with a recruiter if extended an offer). Start dates are offered in May and June.
* As a part of the Workplace Health and Safety Specialist (WHS) internship program, you will learn how to improve the safety and efficiency of our work style processes.
* Onboarding will include OSHA10, First Aid/CPR/AED certification, technical writing and intro to project management training.

  

PLEASE NOTE: For this role, it is essential to have the flexibility to relocate during the summer, as candidate placements will be prioritized based on business requirements. While we take into consideration the placement preferences of candidates, our recruiters will make their best efforts to accommodate location requests. For qualified candidates, we provide relocation and housing assistance to support the transition to the designated work location. Our aim is to ensure that candidates have the necessary support to successfully settle into their new work environment.

Your internship experience will involve a combination of safety\-related projects and WHS organizational learning initiatives.
  

  

Throughout the program, you will learn how to effectively implement safety improvements, identify compliance issues, and recognize opportunities for safety enhancements at your assigned site. Working alongside various safety leaders and stakeholders, you will contribute to creating and maintaining a safe workplace within our Network Distribution Centers. Upon completing your internship, you will be required to present a safety research paper and share the findings of your project with the leadership team. This will allow you to demonstrate your understanding of safety principles and showcase your valuable contributions to promoting a culture of safety within Amazon.  

  

This role will require 100% on\-site attendance located within one of our Network Distribution Centers, and will not be a virtual \- work from home position.
  

  

At Amazon, we thrive in a dynamic and rapidly evolving work environment, and our approach to safety is no exception. Just like the organization itself, our Safety department operates with agility and adaptability. As WHS Interns, you will have the invaluable opportunity to cultivate your own agility, learning to swiftly adjust strategies, plans, and solutions to keep pace with ever\-changing business demands. You will effortlessly learn how to collaborate and lead diverse functional teams and stakeholders across all levels of the organization. Our guiding principles include embracing open\-mindedness, prioritizing customer satisfaction, fostering innovation, promoting empowerment, leveraging advanced technologies, and fostering a strong sense of camaraderie within our team. These principles are what drive our WHS team to deliver cutting\-edge fulfillment solutions.
  

  

You may be wondering, what exactly is fulfillment? Fulfillment, in the context of Amazon, refers to the process of completing and delivering a customer's order from Amazon.com. It encompasses various stages such as picking, packing, shipping, and delivering the order, all with the aim of meeting or exceeding the customer's expectations.  

  

To better understand our operations, let's break down the workflow into three major lanes: first mile, middle mile, and last mile.  

  

* First mile: This is where the product is stored and made ready for picking when an order is placed. It's the starting point of the fulfillment process.
* Middle mile: In this stage, your order is sorted and prepared for distribution to your specific area. It involves efficient logistics and transportation to ensure your package reaches the next destination smoothly.
* Last mile: The last mile represents the final leg of the journey, where the product is delivered right to your doorstep. This step focuses on providing a seamless and convenient delivery experience for our customers.

  

It's important to note that while these lanes may have slight building variations depending on the specific fulfillment center, one constant remains: our unwavering vision and dedication to serving our customers. We strive to continuously improve and optimize our fulfillment processes to ensure customer satisfaction and exceed their expectations. Here are the types of facilities in each mile segment of fulfillment:  

  

* Fulfillment Centers (North America Customer Fulfillment \- NACF Network)o Large facilities with many associates, that house goods, both big and small (first\-mile). These are the types of building that typically come to mind when you hear fulfillment and may contain robotics technology or house the products available when you shop Amazon.com!
* Sort Centers (North America Sort Center \- NASC Network)


o Medium\-sized facilities, localized close to larger markets, where goods are sorted for delivery (middle\-mile). These buildings receive packaged orders and help the last\-mile network deliver products on\-time more efficiently. Orders are sorted by zip code, region, and size. These buildings operate most similarly to a regional post office or large third\-party logistics building.
  

o Air Sites (Amazon Air Network) Amazon’s dedicated Air network serving middle mile, located near or within major airport hubs. These locations require additional security clearances and background checks, managed by the local port authorities.
  

* Delivery Stations (Amazon Logistics \- AMZL Network)o Smaller facilities with fewer associates, localized close to larger markets, where goods are delivered directly to customers (last mile). This is the last stop in the life of an order, where it is packed onto a delivery truck before heading out to the customer’s address.

  

About the Program:
  

  

* The summer term is full\-time (40 hours a week) and lasts 10 weeks during the summer of 2026 (Colleges and Universities where 12 weeks are required for graduation will work directly with a recruiter if extended an offer). Start dates are offered in May and June.
* As a part of the Workplace Health and Safety Specialist (WHS) internship program, you will learn how to improve the safety and efficiency of our work style processes.
* Onboarding will include OSHA10, First Aid/CPR/AED certification, technical writing and intro to project management training.

  

PLEASE NOTE: For this role, it is essential to have the flexibility to relocate during the summer, as candidate placements will be prioritized based on business requirements. While we take into consideration the placement preferences of candidates, our recruiters will make their best efforts to accommodate location requests. For qualified candidates, we provide relocation and housing assistance to support the transition to the designated work location. Our aim is to ensure that candidates have the necessary support to successfully settle into their new work environment.  

  

Based on your performance during the internship, you will have the opportunity to receive an offer for full\-time employment upon graduation. The decision regarding full\-time employment will be communicated to all WHS interns within weeks after the conclusion of their internship. This ensures a timely and efficient process for determining your potential for continued employment with the company.

**Security Clearance**
----------------------

  


This position does not currently require a Department of Energy (DOE) security clearance.


Sandia will conduct a pre\-employment drug test and background review that includes checks of personal references, credit, law enforcement records, and employment/education verifications. Furthermore, employees in New Mexico need to pass a U.S. Air Force background screen for access to Kirtland Air Force Base. Substance abuse or illegal drug use, falsification of information, criminal activity, serious misconduct or other indicators of untrustworthiness can cause access to be denied or terminated, resulting in the inability to perform the duties assigned and subsequent termination of employment. Under federal law, citizens and agents of the People's Republic of China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea, and the Russian Federation are generally prohibited from accessing Sandia National Laboratories. Accordingly, such individuals will not be considered for employment unless they are also a citizen of the United States.


If hired without a clearance and it subsequently becomes necessary to obtain and maintain one for the position, or you bid on positions that require a clearance, a pre\-processing background review may be conducted prior to a required federal background investigation. Applicants for a DOE security clearance need to be U.S. citizens. If you hold more than one citizenship (i.e., of the U.S. and another country), your ability to obtain a security clearance may be impacted.


Members of the workforce (MOWs) hired at Sandia who require uncleared access for greater than 179 days during their employment, are required to go through the Uncleared Personal Identity Verification (UPIV) process. Access includes physical and/or cyber (logical) access, as well as remote access to any NNSA information technology (IT) systems. UPIV requirements are not applicable to individuals who require a DOE personnel security clearance for the performance of their SNL employment or to foreign nationals. The UPIV process will include the completion of a USAccess Enrollment, SF\-85 (Questionnaire for Non\-Sensitive Positions) and OF\-306 (Declaration of for Federal Employment). An unfavorable UPIV determination will result in immediate retrieval of the SNL issued badge, removal of cyber (logical) access and/or removal from SNL subcontract. All MOWs may appeal the unfavorable UPIV determination to DOE/NNSA immediately. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the MOW may try to go through the UPIV process one year after the decision date.

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, or veteran status and any other protected class under state or federal law.


**NNSA Requirements for MedPEDs**
---------------------------------

  


If you have a Medical Portable Electronic Device (MedPED), such as a pacemaker, defibrillator, drug\-releasing pump, hearing aids, or diagnostic equipment and other equipment for measuring, monitoring, and recording body functions such as heartbeat and brain waves, if employed by Sandia National Laboratories you may be required to comply with NNSA security requirements for MedPEDs.


If you have a MedPED and you are selected for an on\-site interview at Sandia National Laboratories, there may be additional steps necessary to ensure compliance with NNSA security requirements prior to the interview date.",2,https://cg.sandia.gov/psc/applicant/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM_FL.HRS_CG_SEARCH_FL.GBL?Page=HRS_APP_JBPST_FL&Action=U&FOCUS=Applicant&SiteId=1&JobOpeningId=696398&PostingSeq=1

"Workplace Health and Safety Specialist Intern West 2025, Amazon North America Customer Fulfillment",Amazon.com,"Monroe, OH, US",indeed,data science intern,"**DESCRIPTION**
---------------


At Amazon, we’re committed to promoting a safe working environment and being the most safety\-centric company for every team member. As an intern, you will have the opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of Amazon Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) practices. Your internship experience will involve a combination of safety\-related projects and WHS organizational learning initiatives.
  

  

Throughout the program, you will learn how to effectively implement safety improvements, identify compliance issues, and recognize opportunities for safety enhancements at your assigned site. Working alongside various safety leaders and stakeholders, you will contribute to creating and maintaining a safe workplace within our Network Distribution Centers.
  

  

Upon completing your internship, you will be required to present a safety research paper and share the findings of your project with the leadership team. This will allow you to demonstrate your understanding of safety principles and showcase your valuable contributions to promoting a culture of safety within Amazon.  

  

This role will require 100% on\-site attendance located within one of our Network Distribution Centers, and will not be a virtual \- work from home position.
  

  

At Amazon, we thrive in a dynamic and rapidly evolving work environment, and our approach to safety is no exception. Just like the organization itself, our Safety department operates with agility and adaptability. As WHS Interns, you will have the invaluable opportunity to cultivate your own agility, learning to swiftly adjust strategies, plans, and solutions to keep pace with ever\-changing business demands. You will effortlessly learn how to collaborate and lead diverse functional teams and stakeholders across all levels of the organization. Our guiding principles include embracing open\-mindedness, prioritizing customer satisfaction, fostering innovation, promoting empowerment, leveraging advanced technologies, and fostering a strong sense of camaraderie within our team. These principles are what drive our WHS team to deliver cutting\-edge fulfillment solutions.
  

  

You may be wondering, what exactly is fulfillment? Fulfillment, in the context of Amazon, refers to the process of completing and delivering a customer's order from Amazon.com. It encompasses various stages such as picking, packing, shipping, and delivering the order, all with the aim of meeting or exceeding the customer's expectations.  

  

To better understand our operations, let's break down the workflow into three major lanes: first mile, middle mile, and last mile.  

* First mile: This is where the product is stored and made ready for picking when an order is placed. It's the starting point of the fulfillment process.
* Middle mile: In this stage, your order is sorted and prepared for distribution to your specific area. It involves efficient logistics and transportation to ensure your package reaches the next destination smoothly
* Last mile: The last mile represents the final leg of the journey, where the product is delivered right to your doorstep. This step focuses on providing a seamless and convenient delivery experience for our customers. It’s important to note that while these lanes may have slight building variations depending on the specific fulfillment center, one constant remains: our unwavering vision and dedication to serving our customers. We strive to continuously improve and optimize our fulfillment processes to ensure customer satisfaction and exceed their expectations. Here are the types of facilities in each mile segment of fulfillment:

  

* Fulfillment Centers (North America Customer Fulfillment \- NACF Network)


o Large facilities with many associates, that house goods, both big and small (first\-mile). These are the types of building that typically come to mind when you hear fulfillment and may contain robotics technology or house the products available when you shop Amazon.com!  

  

* Sort Centers (North America Sort Center \- NASC Network)


o Medium\-sized facilities, localized close to larger markets, where goods are sorted for delivery (middle\-mile).
  

These buildings receive packaged orders and help the last\-mile network deliver products on\-time more
  

efficiently. Orders are sorted by zip code, region, and size. These buildings operate most similarly to a regional
  

post office or large third\-party logistics building.
  

o Air Sites (Amazon Air Network) Amazon’s dedicated Air network serving middle mile, located near or within
  

major airport hubs. These locations require additional security clearances and background checks, managed by
  

the local port authorities.
  

  

* Delivery Stations (Amazon Logistics \- AMZL Network)


o Smaller facilities with fewer associates, localized close to larger markets, where goods are delivered directly to
  

customers (last mile). This is the last stop in the life of an order, where it is packed onto a delivery truck before
  

heading out to the customer’s address.
  

  

PLEASE NOTE: For this role, it is essential to have the flexibility to relocate during the summer, as candidate placements will be prioritized based on business requirements. While we take into consideration the placement preferences of candidates, our recruiters will make their best efforts to accommodate location requests. For qualified candidates, we provide relocation and housing assistance to support the transition to the designated work location. Our aim is to ensure that candidates have the necessary support to successfully settle into their new work environment.  

  

Based on your performance during the internship, you will have the opportunity to receive an offer for full\-time employment upon graduation. The decision regarding full\-time employment will be communicated to all WHS interns within weeks after the conclusion of their internship. This ensures a timely and efficient process for determining your potential for continued employment with the company.

At Amazon, we’re committed to promoting a safe working environment and being the most safety\-centric company for every team member. As an intern, you will have the opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of Amazon Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) practices. Your internship experience will involve a combination of safety\-related projects and WHS organizational learning initiatives.
  

  

Throughout the program, you will learn how to effectively implement safety improvements, identify compliance issues, and recognize opportunities for safety enhancements at your assigned site. Working alongside various safety leaders and stakeholders, you will contribute to creating and maintaining a safe workplace within our Network Distribution Centers.
  

  

Upon completing your internship, you will be required to present a safety research paper and share the findings of your project with the leadership team. This will allow you to demonstrate your understanding of safety principles and showcase your valuable contributions to promoting a culture of safety within Amazon.  

  

This role will require 100% on\-site attendance located within one of our Network Distribution Centers, and will not be a virtual \- work from home position.
  

  

At Amazon, we thrive in a dynamic and rapidly evolving work environment, and our approach to safety is no exception. Just like the organization itself, our Safety department operates with agility and adaptability. As WHS Interns, you will have the invaluable opportunity to cultivate your own agility, learning to swiftly adjust strategies, plans, and solutions to keep pace with ever\-changing business demands. You will effortlessly learn how to collaborate and lead diverse functional teams and stakeholders across all levels of the organization. Our guiding principles include embracing open\-mindedness, prioritizing customer satisfaction, fostering innovation, promoting empowerment, leveraging advanced technologies, and fostering a strong sense of camaraderie within our team. These principles are what drive our WHS team to deliver cutting\-edge fulfillment solutions.
  

  

You may be wondering, what exactly is fulfillment? Fulfillment, in the context of Amazon, refers to the process of completing and delivering a customer's order from Amazon.com. It encompasses various stages such as picking, packing, shipping, and delivering the order, all with the aim of meeting or exceeding the customer's expectations.  

  

To better understand our operations, let's break down the workflow into three major lanes: first mile, middle mile, and last mile.  

* First mile: This is where the product is stored and made ready for picking when an order is placed. It's the starting point of the fulfillment process.
* Middle mile: In this stage, your order is sorted and prepared for distribution to your specific area. It involves efficient logistics and transportation to ensure your package reaches the next destination smoothly
* Last mile: The last mile represents the final leg of the journey, where the product is delivered right to your doorstep. This step focuses on providing a seamless and convenient delivery experience for our customers. It’s important to note that while these lanes may have slight building variations depending on the specific fulfillment center, one constant remains: our unwavering vision and dedication to serving our customers. We strive to continuously improve and optimize our fulfillment processes to ensure customer satisfaction and exceed their expectations. Here are the types of facilities in each mile segment of fulfillment:

  

* Fulfillment Centers (North America Customer Fulfillment \- NACF Network)


o Large facilities with many associates, that house goods, both big and small (first\-mile). These are the types of building that typically come to mind when you hear fulfillment and may contain robotics technology or house the products available when you shop Amazon.com!  

  

* Sort Centers (North America Sort Center \- NASC Network)


o Medium\-sized facilities, localized close to larger markets, where goods are sorted for delivery (middle\-mile).
  

These buildings receive packaged orders and help the last\-mile network deliver products on\-time more
  

efficiently. Orders are sorted by zip code, region, and size. These buildings operate most similarly to a regional
  

post office or large third\-party logistics building.
  

o Air Sites (Amazon Air Network) Amazon’s dedicated Air network serving middle mile, located near or within
  

major airport hubs. These locations require additional security clearances and background checks, managed by
  

the local port authorities.
  

  

* Delivery Stations (Amazon Logistics \- AMZL Network)


o Smaller facilities with fewer associates, localized close to larger markets, where goods are delivered directly to
  

customers (last mile). This is the last stop in the life of an order, where it is packed onto a delivery truck before
  

heading out to the customer’s address.
  

  

PLEASE NOTE: For this role, it is essential to have the flexibility to relocate during the summer, as candidate placements will be prioritized based on business requirements. While we take into consideration the placement preferences of candidates, our recruiters will make their best efforts to accommodate location requests. For qualified candidates, we provide relocation and housing assistance to support the transition to the designated work location. Our aim is to ensure that candidates have the necessary support to successfully settle into their new work environment.  

  

Based on your performance during the internship, you will have the opportunity to receive an offer for full\-time employment upon graduation. The decision regarding full\-time employment will be communicated to all WHS interns within weeks after the conclusion of their internship. This ensures a timely and efficient process for determining your potential for continued employment with the company.  

  

Job Elements:  

Must be able to perform the following tasks, with or without reasonable accommodation:  

* Willing and able to work any shift that may include overnights and holidays. Note that there is a high chance

that your shift may overlap into part of the weekend.  

* Wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment including safety shoes (will be provided)
* Stand/walk for up to 40 hours per week
* Walk in/and around the warehouse with regular frequency; many facilities are over a quarter mile in length
* Access all areas of building (depending on the operations building, this may include ascending and descending

ladders, stairs, gangways, and shipping docks safely and without limitation)
  

* Regularly bend, lift, stretch and reach both below the waist and above the head
* Lift and move items up to 49 pounds

At Amazon, we’re committed to promoting a safe working environment and being the most safety\-centric company for every team member. As an intern, you will have the opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of Amazon Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) practices. Your internship experience will involve a combination of safety\-related projects and WHS organizational learning initiatives.
  

  

Throughout the program, you will learn how to effectively implement safety improvements, identify compliance issues, and recognize opportunities for safety enhancements at your assigned site. Working alongside various safety leaders and stakeholders, you will contribute to creating and maintaining a safe workplace within our Network Distribution Centers.
  

  

Upon completing your internship, you will be required to present a safety research paper and share the findings of your project with the leadership team. This will allow you to demonstrate your understanding of safety principles and showcase your valuable contributions to promoting a culture of safety within Amazon.  

  

This role will require 100% on\-site attendance located within one of our Network Distribution Centers, and will not be a virtual \- work from home position.
  

  

At Amazon, we thrive in a dynamic and rapidly evolving work environment, and our approach to safety is no exception. Just like the organization itself, our Safety department operates with agility and adaptability. As WHS Interns, you will have the invaluable opportunity to cultivate your own agility, learning to swiftly adjust strategies, plans, and solutions to keep pace with ever\-changing business demands. You will effortlessly learn how to collaborate and lead diverse functional teams and stakeholders across all levels of the organization. Our guiding principles include embracing open\-mindedness, prioritizing customer satisfaction, fostering innovation, promoting empowerment, leveraging advanced technologies, and fostering a strong sense of camaraderie within our team. These principles are what drive our WHS team to deliver cutting\-edge fulfillment solutions.
  

  

You may be wondering, what exactly is fulfillment? Fulfillment, in the context of Amazon, refers to the process of completing and delivering a customer's order from Amazon.com. It encompasses various stages such as picking, packing, shipping, and delivering the order, all with the aim of meeting or exceeding the customer's expectations.  

  

To better understand our operations, let's break down the workflow into three major lanes: first mile, middle mile, and last mile.  

* First mile: This is where the product is stored and made ready for picking when an order is placed. It's the starting point of the fulfillment process.
* Middle mile: In this stage, your order is sorted and prepared for distribution to your specific area. It involves efficient logistics and transportation to ensure your package reaches the next destination smoothly
* Last mile: The last mile represents the final leg of the journey, where the product is delivered right to your doorstep. This step focuses on providing a seamless and convenient delivery experience for our customers. It’s important to note that while these lanes may have slight building variations depending on the specific fulfillment center, one constant remains: our unwavering vision and dedication to serving our customers. We strive to continuously improve and optimize our fulfillment processes to ensure customer satisfaction and exceed their expectations. Here are the types of facilities in each mile segment of fulfillment:

  

* Fulfillment Centers (North America Customer Fulfillment \- NACF Network)


o Large facilities with many associates, that house goods, both big and small (first\-mile). These are the types of building that typically come to mind when you hear fulfillment and may contain robotics technology or house the products available when you shop Amazon.com!  

  

* Sort Centers (North America Sort Center \- NASC Network)


o Medium\-sized facilities, localized close to larger markets, where goods are sorted for delivery (middle\-mile).
  

These buildings receive packaged orders and help the last\-mile network deliver products on\-time more
  

efficiently. Orders are sorted by zip code, region, and size. These buildings operate most similarly to a regional
  

post office or large third\-party logistics building.
  

o Air Sites (Amazon Air Network) Amazon’s dedicated Air network serving middle mile, located near or within
  

major airport hubs. These locations require additional security clearances and background checks, managed by
  

the local port authorities.
  

  

* Delivery Stations (Amazon Logistics \- AMZL Network)


o Smaller facilities with fewer associates, localized close to larger markets, where goods are delivered directly to
  

customers (last mile). This is the last stop in the life of an order, where it is packed onto a delivery truck before
  

heading out to the customer’s address.

* Middle mile: In this stage, your order is sorted and prepared for distribution to your specific area. It involves efficient logistics and transportation to ensure your package reaches the next destination smoothly
* Last mile: The last mile represents the final leg of the journey, where the product is delivered right to your doorstep. This step focuses on providing a seamless and convenient delivery experience for our customers. It’s important to note that while these lanes may have slight building variations depending on the specific fulfillment center, one constant remains: our unwavering vision and dedication to serving our customers. We strive to continuously improve and optimize our fulfillment processes to ensure customer satisfaction and exceed their expectations. Here are the types of facilities in each mile segment of fulfillment:

  

* Fulfillment Centers (North America Customer Fulfillment \- NACF Network)


o Large facilities with many associates, that house goods, both big and small (first\-mile). These are the types of building that typically come to mind when you hear fulfillment and may contain robotics technology or house the products available when you shop Amazon.com!  

  

* Sort Centers (North America Sort Center \- NASC Network)


o Medium\-sized facilities, localized close to larger markets, where goods are sorted for delivery (middle\-mile).
  

These buildings receive packaged orders and help the last\-mile network deliver products on\-time more
  

efficiently. Orders are sorted by zip code, region, and size. These buildings operate most similarly to a regional
  

post office or large third\-party logistics building.
  

o Air Sites (Amazon Air Network) Amazon’s dedicated Air network serving middle mile, located near or within
  

major airport hubs. These locations require additional security clearances and background checks, managed by
  

the local port authorities.
  

  

* Delivery Stations (Amazon Logistics \- AMZL Network)


o Smaller facilities with fewer associates, localized close to larger markets, where goods are delivered directly to
  

customers (last mile). This is the last stop in the life of an order, where it is packed onto a delivery truck before
  

heading out to the customer’s address.
  

  

PLEASE NOTE: For this role, it is essential to have the flexibility to relocate during the summer, as candidate placements will be prioritized based on business requirements. While we take into consideration the placement preferences of candidates, our recruiters will make their best efforts to accommodate location requests. For qualified candidates, we provide relocation and housing assistance to support the transition to the designated work location. Our aim is to ensure that candidates have the necessary support to successfully settle into their new work environment.  

  

Based on your performance during the internship, you will have the opportunity to receive an offer for full\-time employment upon graduation. The decision regarding full\-time employment will be communicated to all WHS interns within weeks after the conclusion of their internship. This ensures a timely and efficient process for determining your potential for continued employment with the company.

Throughout the program, you will learn how to effectively implement safety improvements, identify compliance issues, and recognize opportunities for safety enhancements at your assigned site. Working alongside various safety leaders and stakeholders, you will contribute to creating and maintaining a safe workplace within our Network Distribution Centers.
  

  

Upon completing your internship, you will be required to present a safety research paper and share the findings of your project with the leadership team. This will allow you to demonstrate your understanding of safety principles and showcase your valuable contributions to promoting a culture of safety within Amazon.  

  

This role will require 100% on\-site attendance located within one of our Network Distribution Centers, and will not be a virtual \- work from home position.
  

  

At Amazon, we thrive in a dynamic and rapidly evolving work environment, and our approach to safety is no exception. Just like the organization itself, our Safety department operates with agility and adaptability. As WHS Interns, you will have the invaluable opportunity to cultivate your own agility, learning to swiftly adjust strategies, plans, and solutions to keep pace with ever\-changing business demands. You will effortlessly learn how to collaborate and lead diverse functional teams and stakeholders across all levels of the organization. Our guiding principles include embracing open\-mindedness, prioritizing customer satisfaction, fostering innovation, promoting empowerment, leveraging advanced technologies, and fostering a strong sense of camaraderie within our team. These principles are what drive our WHS team to deliver cutting\-edge fulfillment solutions.
  

  

You may be wondering, what exactly is fulfillment? Fulfillment, in the context of Amazon, refers to the process of completing and delivering a customer's order from Amazon.com. It encompasses various stages such as picking, packing, shipping, and delivering the order, all with the aim of meeting or exceeding the customer's expectations.  

  

To better understand our operations, let's break down the workflow into three major lanes: first mile, middle mile, and last mile.  

* First mile: This is where the product is stored and made ready for picking when an order is placed. It's the starting point of the fulfillment process.
* Middle mile: In this stage, your order is sorted and prepared for distribution to your specific area. It involves efficient logistics and transportation to ensure your package reaches the next destination smoothly
* Last mile: The last mile represents the final leg of the journey, where the product is delivered right to your doorstep. This step focuses on providing a seamless and convenient delivery experience for our customers. It’s important to note that while these lanes may have slight building variations depending on the specific fulfillment center, one constant remains: our unwavering vision and dedication to serving our customers. We strive to continuously improve and optimize our fulfillment processes to ensure customer satisfaction and exceed their expectations. Here are the types of facilities in each mile segment of fulfillment:

  

* Fulfillment Centers (North America Customer Fulfillment \- NACF Network)


o Large facilities with many associates, that house goods, both big and small (first\-mile). These are the types of building that typically come to mind when you hear fulfillment and may contain robotics technology or house the products available when you shop Amazon.com!  

  

* Sort Centers (North America Sort Center \- NASC Network)


o Medium\-sized facilities, localized close to larger markets, where goods are sorted for delivery (middle\-mile).
  

These buildings receive packaged orders and help the last\-mile network deliver products on\-time more
  

efficiently. Orders are sorted by zip code, region, and size. These buildings operate most similarly to a regional
  

post office or large third\-party logistics building.
  

o Air Sites (Amazon Air Network) Amazon’s dedicated Air network serving middle mile, located near or within
  

major airport hubs. These locations require additional security clearances and background checks, managed by
  

the local port authorities.
  

  

* Delivery Stations (Amazon Logistics \- AMZL Network)


o Smaller facilities with fewer associates, localized close to larger markets, where goods are delivered directly to
  

customers (last mile). This is the last stop in the life of an order, where it is packed onto a delivery truck before
  

heading out to the customer’s address.
  

  

PLEASE NOTE: For this role, it is essential to have the flexibility to relocate during the summer, as candidate placements will be prioritized based on business requirements. While we take into consideration the placement preferences of candidates, our recruiters will make their best efforts to accommodate location requests. For qualified candidates, we provide relocation and housing assistance to support the transition to the designated work location. Our aim is to ensure that candidates have the necessary support to successfully settle into their new work environment.

This ensures a timely and efficient process for determining your potential for continued employment with the company.

**Security Clearance**
----------------------

  


This position does not currently require a Department of Energy (DOE) security clearance.


Sandia will conduct a pre\-employment drug test and background review that includes checks of personal references, credit, law enforcement records, and employment/education verifications. Furthermore, employees in New Mexico need to pass a U.S. Air Force background screen for access to Kirtland Air Force Base. Substance abuse or illegal drug use, falsification of information, criminal activity, serious misconduct or other indicators of untrustworthiness can cause access to be denied or terminated, resulting in the inability to perform the duties assigned and subsequent termination of employment. Under federal law, citizens and agents of the People's Republic of China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea, and the Russian Federation are generally prohibited from accessing Sandia National Laboratories. Accordingly, such individuals will not be considered for employment unless they are also a citizen of the United States.


If hired without a clearance and it subsequently becomes necessary to obtain and maintain one for the position, or you bid on positions that require a clearance, a pre\-processing background review may be conducted prior to a required federal background investigation. Applicants for a DOE security clearance need to be U.S. citizens. If you hold more than one citizenship (i.e., of the U.S. and another country), your ability to obtain a security clearance may be impacted.


Members of the workforce (MOWs) hired at Sandia who require uncleared access for greater than 179 days during their employment, are required to go through the Uncleared Personal Identity Verification (UPIV) process. Access includes physical and/or cyber (logical) access, as well as remote access to any NNSA information technology (IT) systems. UPIV requirements are not applicable to individuals who require a DOE personnel security clearance for the performance of their SNL employment or to foreign nationals. The UPIV process will include the completion of a USAccess Enrollment, SF\-85 (Questionnaire for Non\-Sensitive Positions) and OF\-306 (Declaration of for Federal Employment). An unfavorable UPIV determination will result in immediate retrieval of the SNL issued badge, removal of cyber (logical) access and/or removal from SNL subcontract. All MOWs may appeal the unfavorable UPIV determination to DOE/NNSA immediately. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the MOW may try to go through the UPIV process one year after the decision date.
